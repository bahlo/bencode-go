Wikipedia [about Bencode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode):
```
Bencode (pronounced like B encode) is the encoding used by the peer-to-peer
file sharing system BitTorrent for storing and transmitting loosely structured
data.

It supports four different types of values:

- byte strings,
- integers,
- lists, and
- dictionaries (associative arrays).

Bencoding is most commonly used in torrent files. These metadata files are
simply bencoded dictionaries.

[Bencode spec](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Bencoding).
